This assignment built on classes with overload funtions and friend functions.
In this case, the standard mathematical operators are overloaded for a class used for imaginary numbers, as these operators would not otherwise produce the correct results.
The friend functions are then used to input and output the imaginary numbers in a visually pleasing manner.
