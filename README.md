# code_portfolio
This repositary is a collection of code I have written for a variety of purposes. The majority are from two university courses completed during my MPhys University Degree. The first course is about scientific programming, involving data processing and visual displays of graphs in Python. The second course is about Object Oriented Programming in C++ and are example documents required to demonstrate our understanding of the course's content. This is most of my formal education in computer programming. However during secondary school, I achieved an A* grade in an extra-curricular GCSE in computer programming, which was self-taught and supplemented by extra-curricular lessons from older students where I learned Python. Then in Sixth Form I used this knowledge to write two more pieces of code for my Extended Project Qualification (A-level equivalent), one of which was a neural net to demonstrate mahcine learning.
Beside this all of my coding knowledge has been entirely self-taught.
