After completing the last assignment for my Object Oriented Programming course I wanted to try and make a game that actually had a graphical interface. I decided on using card games as a template due to their short and simple ruleset so that I could focus on the coding side, and I used C# and the Monogame engine to write it. 
I spent some time working on it over the summer and learnt a lot about what it takes to fully produce a game, and realised that the scope of even a theoretically simple game like a digital card game takes a lot of work to complete, such as the amount of code that is required simply to make sure that the game can render fullscreen on a variety of resolutions and still be readable and visually appealing. A sample of the code for this project is kept in this folder as a demonstration of what I learned and wrote during hte project. After finishing the C++ course, a lot of C# was very familiar, although I enjoyed being able to interact more directly with a wider range of user input like button presses and mouse position, and making use of new data structures enumerated types for the cards.
